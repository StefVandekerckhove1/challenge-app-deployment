# API deployment

- Repository: `challenge-app-deployment`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `5 days`
- Deadline: `18/12/2024 17:00` 
- Presentation: `20/12/2024 10:30`
- Team challenge : Solo

## Mission objectives

- Be able to deploy a machine learning model.
- Be able to create a streamlit app that can handle a machine learning model.

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" is really happy about your regression model. 
They would like you to create an app to let their team play with your model and make predictions on an app.

### Must-have features

#### Step 1: Project preparation

- Create a folder to handle your project.
- Create a file `app.py` that will contain the code for your API.
- Create a folder `preprocessing/` that will contain all the code to preprocess your data.
- Create a folder `model/` that will contain your model.
- Create a folder `predict/` that will contain all the code to predict a price.

#### Step 2: Preprocessing pipeline

This python module will contain all the code to preprocess your data. Make sure to think about what will be the format of your data to fit the model.
Also, be sure to know which information HAVE to be there and which one can be empty (NAN).

In the `preprocessing/` folder:

- Create the `cleaning_data.py` file that will contain all the code that will be used to preprocess the data you will receive to predict a new price. (fill the NaN values, handle text data, etc...).
- This file should contain a function called `preprocess()` that will take a new house's data as input and return those data preprocessed as output.
- If your data doesn't contain the required information, you should return an error to the user.

#### Step 3: Prediction

In the precedent project, you made a ML model to predict the price of a house.

Of course, we don't want to train the model each time we launch the API. Find a way to save your model, and add it to a `models` folder at the root of your project.

In the `predict/` folder:

- Create the `prediction.py` file that will contain all the code used to predict a new house's price.
- Your file should contain a function `predict()` that will take your preprocessed data as an input and return a price as output.

#### Step 4: Create your APP

See some resource here:
- https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app
- https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-ml-models-using-streamlit-5d6212453bdd

If your model file is too big you can get issue to deploy it on streamlit because there are limitations. Don't panic, you'll show it on local.

You must be able to manually add features values on the streamlit app in order to make predictions. Imagine you want to buy a house and you wonder if its price is not exaggerated. You can use this tool to simulate the value of the property to get an idea of ​​the market.
##### How to present ?

- You'll present your app in front of the team (2-3min maximum) and if needed (if there is not a best model) we will vote to select for each group the app that you'll show in front of Immoweb. 
- Details for Immoweb presentation will follow. 

## Constraints

### Code style

- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring**
- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented** when necessary.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.
- Clean the git repository and delete useless branches
- OOP


## Deliverables

1. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
2. Your APP is deployed on Streamlit.
3. You documentation is clear.
